🛡️ 7 Cybersecurity Analyst Projects for Job Preparation

1. SIEM Dashboard with Splunk or ELK

🔧 What to Do:
 • Set up a Splunk or ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) stack.
 • Ingest logs from simulated attacks (try with a virtual lab like Metasploitable or Security Onion).
 • Create dashboards to monitor anomalies.

💼 Skills Shown: Log analysis, SIEM, threat detection, incident investigation.

2. Build Your Own Threat Intelligence Report

🔧 What to Do:
 • Pick a recent real-world cyberattack (e.g., SolarWinds, MOVEit).
 • Investigate using open-source intel (OSINT), MITRE ATT&CK, and CVE databases.
 • Write a report: attack summary, indicators of compromise (IOCs), mitigation steps.

💼 Skills Shown: OSINT, research, threat hunting, writing/reporting.

3. Network Traffic Analysis with Wireshark & TCPdump

🔧 What to Do:
 • Capture and analyze network traffic.
 • Identify suspicious patterns (e.g., DNS tunneling, beaconing behavior).
 • Create a short documentation/report.

💼 Skills Shown: Packet analysis, network security, intrusion detection.

⸻

4. Vulnerability Scanning & Reporting

🔧 What to Do:
 • Use OpenVAS, Nessus, or Nmap to scan a vulnerable VM (like Metasploitable or OWASP Juice Shop).
 • Analyze the vulnerabilities and prioritize them.
 • Write a remediation report.

💼 Skills Shown: Vulnerability assessment, risk analysis, reporting.

5. Incident Response Playbook Creation

🔧 What to Do:
 • Choose 2–3 attack scenarios (phishing, malware outbreak, insider threat).
 • Build detailed IR playbooks: detection, containment, eradication, recovery.
 • Include tools, checklists, and escalation paths.

💼 Skills Shown: Incident response planning, security operations, documentation.

⸻

6. MITRE ATT&CK Mapping Lab

🔧 What to Do:
 • Simulate basic attacker techniques in a lab (use tools like Caldera or Atomic Red Team).
 • Map each action to MITRE ATT&CK tactics and techniques.
 • Document the detection and logging process.

💼 Skills Shown: Threat modeling, adversary emulation, MITRE framework.

⸻

7. Cloud Security Monitoring Project

🔧 What to Do:
 • Set up a basic AWS environment (free tier).
 • Enable CloudTrail, GuardDuty, or Security Hub.
 • Simulate login anomalies or policy violations.
 • Analyze alerts and create a report.

💼 Skills Shown: Cloud security, AWS, monitoring & response.
