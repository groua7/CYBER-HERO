# AWS Static Website Hosting (S3 + Route53 + CloudFront + ACM)

This guide shows you how to host a static website using:
- **Amazon S3** for storage
- **Amazon Route 53** for domain name
- **AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)** for HTTPS
- **Amazon CloudFront** as the CDN (with secure access to S3 only)

We will **not** grant public access to the S3 bucket. Instead, CloudFront will securely access the content using an origin access control (OAC) and a bucket policy.

---

## üîß Prerequisites
- An AWS account
- A registered domain name (via Route53 or any registrar)

---

## ü™ú Steps

### 1. **Create an S3 Bucket**
- Name it the same as your domain, e.g. `example.com`
- Disable "Block all public access"
- Do **not** enable static website hosting

### 2. **Upload Website Files**
```bash
aws s3 sync ./website s3://example.com
```

### 3. **Create an Origin Access Control (OAC)**
- Go to CloudFront > Security > Origin access > Create origin access control
- Name it `S3-OAC`, sign requests (recommended)

### 4. **Attach a Bucket Policy**
Replace `BUCKET_NAME` and `CLOUDFRONT_OAC_ID` accordingly.
```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "Service": "cloudfront.amazonaws.com"
      },
      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::example.com/*",
      "Condition": {
        "StringEquals": {
          "AWS:SourceArn": "arn:aws:cloudfront::ACCOUNT_ID:distribution/DISTRIBUTION_ID"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### 5. **Request an SSL Certificate (ACM)**
- Region: **us-east-1** (for CloudFront)
- Request a public certificate for `example.com` and `www.example.com`
- Validate via DNS (ACM will give DNS records to add in Route53)

### 6. **Create a CloudFront Distribution**
- Origin domain: your S3 bucket (select it, not type it manually)
- Origin Access: choose your OAC
- Viewer protocol policy: Redirect HTTP to HTTPS
- Alternate domain names (CNAMEs): `example.com`, `www.example.com`
- SSL Certificate: Select the one you created in ACM
- Default root object: `index.html`

### 7. **Set Up Route 53 DNS Records**
- Go to your hosted zone in Route 53
- Add **A (Alias)** records for:
  - `example.com` ‚Üí CloudFront distribution
  - `www.example.com` ‚Üí CloudFront distribution

### 8. **Test Your Website**
- Wait for DNS and CloudFront distribution to propagate (~5‚Äì10 minutes)
- Visit `https://example.com` in your browser

## ‚úÖ Summary
You‚Äôve launched a secure static site using:
- ‚úÖ S3 (no public access)
- ‚úÖ CloudFront (with OAC)
- ‚úÖ HTTPS via ACM
- ‚úÖ Domain management via Route53

## üìå Notes
- Use CloudFront invalidations to update content instantly
- Store logs and enable versioning for your S3 bucket
- Consider enabling WAF (Web Application Firewall) for added security
