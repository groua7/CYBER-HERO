üõ° What Are Cybersecurity Controls?

Cybersecurity controls are safeguards or countermeasures to avoid, detect, counteract, or minimize security risks to physical property, information, computer systems, or other assets.

‚∏ª

üîê Types of Controls

1. Administrative Controls

These are policies, procedures, and guidelines.
 ‚Ä¢ Security policies
 ‚Ä¢ User training and awareness
 ‚Ä¢ Hiring practices
 ‚Ä¢ Access reviews

2. Technical Controls

These are logical controls enforced through technology.
 ‚Ä¢ Firewalls
 ‚Ä¢ Antivirus software
 ‚Ä¢ Encryption
 ‚Ä¢ Authentication mechanisms
 ‚Ä¢ IDS/IPS systems

3. Physical Controls

Designed to prevent physical access to systems.
 ‚Ä¢ Locks
 ‚Ä¢ Security guards
 ‚Ä¢ Fences
 ‚Ä¢ CCTV
 ‚Ä¢ Biometric access systems

‚∏ª

üß≠ Control Function Categories

1. Preventive Controls

Stop incidents before they occur.
 ‚Ä¢ Firewalls
 ‚Ä¢ Security awareness training
 ‚Ä¢ Strong passwords

2. Detective Controls

Identify and react to incidents.
 ‚Ä¢ Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)
 ‚Ä¢ Audit logs
 ‚Ä¢ Video surveillance

3. Corrective Controls

Mitigate the impact and restore systems.
 ‚Ä¢ Patch management
 ‚Ä¢ Backup and recovery solutions
 ‚Ä¢ Incident response plans

4. Deterrent Controls

Discourage malicious actions.
 ‚Ä¢ Warning signs
 ‚Ä¢ Login banners
 ‚Ä¢ Security policies
 * CCTV

5. Compensating Controls

Alternative controls when primary ones aren‚Äôt feasible.
 ‚Ä¢ Manual logging in place of automatic logging
 ‚Ä¢ Dual-authentication if biometric not available

üéì For CySA+ Learners

CySA+ takes it further by focusing on threat detection, incident response, and proactive security:
 ‚Ä¢ SIEM Configuration & Analysis
 ‚Ä¢ Behavioral Analytics
 ‚Ä¢ Threat Intelligence Integration
 ‚Ä¢ Vulnerability Management Processes
 ‚Ä¢ Risk Mitigation Techniques

Understanding how controls fit into frameworks like NIST, ISO 27001, and MITRE ATT&CK will elevate your skillset.
