Roadmap: Using Kali Linux in Your Journey to Become a Cybersecurity Analyst



✅ Step 1: Understand What Kali Linux Is
Kali Linux is a Debian-based Linux distribution tailored for penetration testing, digital forensics, and ethical hacking.

It comes pre-loaded with 600+ security tools (like Nmap, Metasploit, Wireshark, Burp Suite, etc.).



✅ Step 2: Install Kali Linux
Options:

As a Virtual Machine (using VMware or VirtualBox)

As a dual boot on hardware

Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) (for Windows users)

Follow Kali.org's installation guide for best practices.



✅ Step 3: Learn the Kali Linux Environment
Basic Linux terminal commands: ls, cd, cat, nano, chmod, sudo, etc.

Understand file structure: /etc, /var, /usr/bin, etc.

Practice bash scripting to automate tasks.



✅ Step 4: Master Kali's Core Tools
🔧 Reconnaissance:
Nmap: Network scanning

Recon-ng: Open-source intelligence

theHarvester: Email and domain harvesting

🛡️ Vulnerability Scanning:
Nikto: Web server scanner

OpenVAS: Vulnerability scanner

🎯 Exploitation:
Metasploit Framework: Launch and test exploits

SQLmap: SQL injection automation

🧪 Post-Exploitation:
Empire: PowerShell post-exploitation

John the Ripper: Password cracking



✅ Step 5: Practice Ethical Hacking Labs
Use Kali with vulnerable environments:



TryHackMe

Hack The Box

Metasploitable 2/3

DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application)

Document your findings and steps (this builds a portfolio).



✅ Step 6: Build a GitHub Project
📁 Recommended GitHub Project:
Title: kali-cybersecurity-lab-journal

Structure:

bash
Copy
Edit
/kali-cybersecurity-lab-journal
├── README.md
├── network_scanning/
│   └── nmap_cheatsheet.md
├── vulnerability_analysis/
│   └── nikto_scan_report.md
├── exploitation/
│   └── metasploit_walkthrough.md
├── passwords/
│   └── john_cracking_examples.md
├── scripts/
│   └── auto_scan.sh
Why?

This acts as your learning journal and portfolio.

Helps you track progress and showcase hands-on skills to employers.

Recruiters and hiring managers love seeing organized, real-world documentation.



✅ Step 7: Move Beyond Tools
Learn the MITRE ATT&CK framework to understand attacker behaviors.

Study logs and SIEM tools (Splunk, ELK).

Get familiar with incident response procedures.



✅ Step 8: Certifications to Validate Your Skills
CompTIA Security+

CompTIA CySA+

eJPT (from INE)

OSCP (OffSec Certified Professional) – very Kali-heavy
