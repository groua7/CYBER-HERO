🔐 Top Frameworks Every Cybersecurity Analyst Should Know

⚠️ NOTE: This guide is intended as a foundational reference for cybersecurity students, professionals, and ethical hackers. Each framework listed here plays a critical role in either governance, detection, response, or continuous improvement in cybersecurity operations.


🧭 1. NIST Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF)

Big Idea: Provides a structured approach to managing and reducing cybersecurity risks.

Core Functions: Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover.

Use Case: Used by businesses and government agencies to build a strong security program and evaluate risk.


🛡️ 2. MITRE ATT&CK

Big Idea: A globally accessible knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world observations.

Focus Areas: TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by threat actors.

Use Case: Threat detection, threat hunting, red teaming, SOC analysis.


🕵️ 3. Lockheed Martin Cyber Kill Chain

Big Idea: A model that outlines the stages of a cyber attack from reconnaissance to exfiltration.

Stages: Recon, Weaponization, Delivery, Exploitation, Installation, Command & Control, Actions on Objectives.

Use Case: Helps understand attacker behavior and how to break the chain to stop attacks early.


📋 4. CIS Controls (Center for Internet Security Controls)

Big Idea: A prioritized set of cybersecurity best practices.

Key Features: 18 critical security controls grouped by implementation tiers.

Use Case: Used to improve cyber hygiene, especially in small to mid-sized organizations.


🏛️ 5. ISO/IEC 27001

Big Idea: International standard for information security management systems (ISMS).

Focus: Risk management, compliance, and protecting sensitive information.

Use Case: Adopted by organizations for certification, data governance, and international compliance.


🧪 6. OWASP Top 10

Big Idea: A regularly-updated list of the top 10 most critical web application security risks.

Recent Focus: Injection, Broken Auth, Insecure Design, etc.

Use Case: Web app development, secure coding, application security testing.


🧰 7. NIST SP 800 Series

Big Idea: A collection of publications by NIST to support federal information systems security.

Notable Docs: SP 800-53 (controls), SP 800-171 (contractor security), SP 800-61 (incident response).

Use Case: Federal security requirements, compliance, risk management frameworks.


⚙️ 8. COBIT (Control Objectives for Information and Related Technologies)

Big Idea: A framework for IT management and governance.

Focus: Aligning IT goals with business objectives.

Use Case: Enterprise IT governance, audit, and compliance.


🌍 9. GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)

Big Idea: Legal framework for data protection and privacy in the EU.

Core Focus: Consent, data minimization, rights of data subjects.

Use Case: Compliance for companies handling EU citizen data.

🧬 10. Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA)

Big Idea: "Never trust, always verify." No user or device is trusted by default.

Principles: Least privilege, micro-segmentation, continuous verification.


Use Case: Modern enterprise networks, remote work security, identity-based access control.

✅ Pro Tip: Cybersecurity is about layers—use these frameworks together to build strong, adaptive, and compliant security programs.
